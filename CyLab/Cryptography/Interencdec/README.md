## 🔎 Description / Context

**Objective**  
You were given the file content: YidkM0JxZGtwQlRYdHFhR3g2YUhsZmF6TnFlVGwzWVROclh6ZzJhMnd6TW1zeWZRPT0nCg==

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
- A modern web browser and access to CyberChef (or any tool/script that can do Base64 and Caesar shifts)  
- Basic familiarity with Base64 and Caesar cipher (mod 26)

---

## ▶️ Quick steps / Approach
1. decode the provided string 
2. Base64-decode the inner payload  
3. Apply a Caesar shift
4. The result is the readable flag.

## 🧭 Solution (SPOILER)

- Base64
- Caesar shift-7

## ❌ Common mistakes

- Trying only one decoding method (e.g., a single Base64 decode) and stopping.  
- Applying ROT13 instead of identifying the correct Caesar shift.  
- Applying the Caesar shift before fully decoding the Base64 layers.  
- Altering non-letter characters (digits, underscores, braces) when shifting — only letters should be shifted.

## ✅ What I learned (notes)

- Challenges often layer simple encodings; try peeling layers iteratively.  
- After Base64 decodes, check whether the result is raw bytes, a quoted string, or another encoded blob.  
- Caesar shifts can use any offset — try small shifts if the result looks close to readable text.  
- CyberChef lets you chain operations (From Base64 → From Base64 → Caesar) for rapid experimentation.
