## Overview
VulnHub provides a collection of downloadable virtual machines (VMs) intentionally designed with security vulnerabilities. Learners can safely practice penetration testing, vulnerability exploitation, and cybersecurity techniques in a legal and controlled environment. The platform is suitable for beginners as well as advanced learners.

---

## Getting Started
1. Visit [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com) and browse available machines.  
2. Download a VM image (usually `.ova` for VirtualBox or VMware).  
3. Import the VM into your virtualization software (VirtualBox, VMware, etc.).  
4. Start the VM and begin exploring its network and services.  
5. Use common pentesting tools: `nmap`, `netcat`, `curl`, `burpsuite`, `gdb`, `radare2`, `john`, `hydra`, and Python scripting.  
6. Work methodically: enumerate, analyze, exploit, and document your findings.

## Types of Machines
- **Beginner-Friendly:** Simple machines focused on fundamental concepts.  
- **Intermediate:** More complex setups, multiple services, or chained vulnerabilities.  
- **Advanced:** Realistic, multi-layered, and challenging machines designed to mimic real-world scenarios.  
- **Specialized:** Machines emphasizing web, binary exploitation, network, or OS-specific vulnerabilities.  

---

## Learning Resources & Tools
- Recommended environment: a Linux VM or host, virtualization software (VirtualBox/VMware), and snapshots enabled.  
- Tools: `nmap`, `netcat`, `tcpdump`, `wireshark`, `gdb`, `radare2`, `burpsuite`, `python3`, and other standard pentesting utilities.  
- Community writeups and walkthroughs are useful after attempting a machine; follow spoiler etiquette to preserve learning.  

---

## How to Practice
- **Solo:** Download and attack machines on your own.  
- **Team:** Collaborate with peers to solve more complex machines.  
- **Document:** Keep notes, screenshots, and commands to track learning progress.  
- **Learn & Share:** After completing machines, consider writing your own walkthroughs for educational purposes.  

---

## Security & Responsible Use
- Only interact with VulnHub-provided virtual machines. Do not target external systems without authorization.  
- Use snapshots and isolated environments to prevent host compromise.  
- Do not publicly share exploit scripts targeting real-world systems; limit sharing to educational VMs.
