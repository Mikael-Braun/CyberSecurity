## Overview
picoCTF is a free, annual CTF and an always-available practice platform designed to teach cybersecurity fundamentals through fun, story-driven challenges. It targets middle‑ and high‑school students but is widely used by learners of all ages. Challenges are crafted to introduce core concepts in a friendly, scaffolded way.

---

## Getting Started
1. Visit https://picoctf.org and register for an account (or join during the annual event if running).  
2. Explore beginner tracks and tutorials if you are new to cybersecurity.  
3. Start with basic categories (forensics, web, cryptography, reversing, binary exploitation, pwn, misc).  
4. Use common tools: browser DevTools, `strings`, `file`, `gdb`/`radare2`, `binwalk`, `curl`, `netcat`, Python, and text-processing utilities.  
5. Work through challenges at your own pace, many include hints and progressive scoring.

## Types of Challenges
- **Forensics:** Extracting data from files, images, or network captures.  
- **Web Exploitation:** Finding and exploiting common web vulnerabilities.  
- **Cryptography:** Basic cryptography concepts and breaking weak schemes.  
- **Reverse Engineering:** Analyzing binaries to extract secrets or logic.  
- **Binary Exploitation:** Low-level exploitation (memory corruption, format strings), typically more advanced.  
- **General Skills:** Logic puzzles, OSINT, or knowledge-based tasks.

---

## Learning Resources & Tools
- picoCTF provides tutorials and a learning portal for new participants.  
- Recommended beginner tools: a Linux VM, Python 3, Wireshark, Ghidra (or radare2), Binary Ninja (if available), and basic command-line utilities.  
- Community writeups (after attempting a challenge) and official tutorials are valuable for learning, follow spoiler etiquette.

---

## For Educators
- picoCTF offers classroom resources and instructor guides to integrate CTF-style learning into coursework.  
- Educators can create teams, track student progress, and use practice challenges as assignments.  
- Check picoCTF’s educator resources for setup guides, sample lesson plans, and safety guidelines.

---

## How to Participate
- Individual: register and solve challenges solo.  
- Team: form a team to collaborate during events. Teams are useful for mixing skill sets.  
- Competition: watch for the annual picoCTF event (typically with themed storyline and scoreboard).  
- Share learning: after attempting challenges, consider writing a teachable writeup (mark spoilers clearly).

---

## Security & Responsible Use
- Only interact with picoCTF’s provided infrastructure and test assets. Do not reuse exploit techniques against unauthorized third-party systems.  
- Use isolated environments (VMs or containers) for running untrusted binaries.  
- Respect the platform’s rules about sharing solutions, spoilers, and writeups. Sanitize any shared logs/screenshots.
