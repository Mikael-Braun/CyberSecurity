- **Source:** PicoCTF  
- **Type of challenge:** Cryptography / ROT13  
- **Difficulty:** Medium  
- **Goal:** Decode the flag encrypted with ROT13

---

## 🔎 Description / Context

**Objective**  
You are given the following ciphertext:  cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}


---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
- A modern web browser and access to CyberChef (or any tool/script that can perform ROT13)  
- Basic understanding of ROT13 / Caesar cipher (shift = 13)  

---

## ▶️ Quick steps / Approach
1. Open CyberChef (or any ROT13 tool).  
2. Paste the ciphertext into the input panel.  
3. Add the **ROT13** operation.  
4. The output will reveal the plaintext / flag.

## ❌ Common mistakes

- Forgetting ROT13 is symmetric, applying it twice returns to the original ciphertext.
- Trying more complex ciphers when the hint explicitly mentions ROT13.
- Altering characters inside the braces or underscores when decoding.

## ✅ What I learned (notes)

- ROT13 is a simple substitution cipher (Caesar shift of 13) often used in beginner CTF challenges.
- CyberChef can quickly decode ROT13 text.
- Flags often include underscores and braces — leave non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
