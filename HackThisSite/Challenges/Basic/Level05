# Basic - Level 05


## Objective  
Retrieve the password sent to an email.


## Context  
"Sam has gotten wise to all the people who wrote their own forms to get the password. Rather than actually learn the password, he decided to make his email program a little more secure." This level demonstrates manipulation of hidden form fields to control input values like level 04.


## Difficulty  
Easy


## Tools used  
Web browser 
DevTools(Inspect Element / View Source)


## Solution  
1.Inspect the form and locate <input type="hidden" name="email">.
2.Replace its value with your registered HTS email.
3.Submit the form.
4.Check your email to obtain the password and submit it to the level.


## Common mistakes  
- Not changing the hidden email field.
- Forgetting to use your own registered email.


## Visual  
<!-- Hidden input field contains the target email; editing it allows password delivery. 
Sam,
Here is the password: 'c5b81392'-->


## What I learned  
Client-side validation can always be inspected or bypassed; real validation should be server-side.
