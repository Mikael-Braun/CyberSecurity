# Basic - Level 03


##Objective
Find the password hidden in a file.


##Context
"This time Network Security Sam remembered to upload the password file, but there were deeper problems than that."
This level teaches you how to discover hidden files referenced by the HTML.


##Difficulty
Easy


##Tools used
Web browser 
DevTools (Ctrl + Shift + I / Inspect Element)


##Solution
1.Inspect HTML source.
2.Look for <input type="hidden"> or hints about a file.
3.Navigate directly to the file URL in the browser(.../missions/basic/3/password.php)
4.Copy the password from the file and submit.


##Common mistakes
- Ignoring hidden inputs.
- Trying random guesses instead of inspecting the source.


##Visual
<!-- Hidden input points to password file; open it to see password. -->


##What I learned
Hidden references in HTML can guide you to files not visibly linked.
