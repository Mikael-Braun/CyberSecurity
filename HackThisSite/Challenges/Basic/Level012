# Basic - Level 01


## Objective  
Find the password for the next level.


## Context  
"This level is what we call "The Idiot Test." If you can't complete it, don't give up on learning as much as you can. But don't go asking others for the answer—that's one way to get disliked or made fun of. Enter the password and you can continue."


## Difficulty  
Easy


## Tools used  
Web browser (Inspect Element / View Source)


## Solution  
1. View the source of the page (Ctrl + U).  
2. Look line by line for a comment.  
3. The comment contains the password.


## Common mistakes  
- Not checking the source code and only looking at the visible page.  
- Missing the HTML comments because they are hidden.


## Visual  
<!-- the first few levels are extremely easy: password is 265efd1f -->


## What I learned  
Inspecting the source code of a webpage is a simple but powerful skill that helps uncover hidden information.
