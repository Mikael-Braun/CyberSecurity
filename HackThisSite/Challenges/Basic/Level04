# Basic - Level 04


## Objective  
Retrieve the password sent to an email.


## Context  
"This time Sam hardcoded the password into the script. However, the password is long and complex, and Sam is often forgetful. So he wrote a script that would email his password to him automatically in case he forgot." This level demonstrates manipulation of hidden form fields to control input values.


## Difficulty  
Easy


## Tools used  
Web browser 
DevTools(Inspect Element / View Source)


## Solution  
1.Inspect the form and locate <input type="hidden" name="email">.
2.Replace its value with your registered HTS email.
3.Submit the form.
4.Check your email to obtain the password and submit it to the level.


## Common mistakes  
- Not changing the hidden email field.
- Forgetting to use your own registered email.


## Visual  
<!-- Hidden input field contains the target email; editing it allows password delivery. 
Sam,
Here is the password: '6c58a59c'.-->


## What I learned  
Hidden inputs can be manipulated client-side to redirect output.
