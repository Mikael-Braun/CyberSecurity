# Basic - Level 06


## Objective  
Retrieve the password sent to an email.


## Context  
"Network Security Sam has encrypted his password. The encryption system is publically available and can be accessed with this form" The level uses a simple cipher to encode passwords. Understanding the pattern allows decryption.


## Difficulty  
medium


## Tools used  
Paper and pen


## Solution  
1.Observe how input text is transformed in the cipher box.
2.Test simple patterns (aaaaa, 12345, abcabc) to understand how characters shift.
3.Deduce the algorithm by analyzing patterns.
4.Reverse the cipher to decode the given string and retrieve the password.


## Common mistakes  
- Ignoring patterns or assuming a complex algorithm.
- Not testing simple inputs.


## Visual  
<!-- Cipher box changes letters in a predictable pattern. each place of a number is change by the next number acording to the patern
eg: 12345 ->> 13579   -->


## What I learned  
Basic ciphers teach logic and pattern recognition.
