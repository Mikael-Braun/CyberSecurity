# Basic - Level 07


## Objective  
Use command injection to list a file containing the password.


## Context  
"This time Network Security sam has saved the unencrypted level7 password in an obscurely named file saved in this very directory. In other unrelated news, Sam has set up a script that returns the output from the UNIX cal command. Here is the script:" This level introduces basic command injection by sending input to a server command.


## Difficulty  
medium


## Tools used  
Web browser 
DevTools(Inspect Element / View Source)


## Solution  
1.Identify the input field that reaches a system command.
2.Use a safe command separator (e.g., ;) to execute harmless commands like ls.
3.Locate the file containing the password.
4.Open that file via URL to obtain the password.


## Common mistakes  
- Trying dangerous commands.
- Ignoring how the input is passed to the server command.


## Visual  
<!-- Input allows command injection; `ls` lists files including password file. password: 5e3dbf10 -->


## What I learned  
Command injection is powerful but dangerous; practice only in controlled environments.
