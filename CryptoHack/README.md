## Overview
CryptoHack is an interactive platform for learning cryptography concepts through progressive, hands-on challenges. Suitable for beginners, it is also useful for more advanced learners who want to practice real-world crypto attacks in a safe environment.

---

## Core Features
- Step-by-step tutorials for beginners.
- Interactive, hands-on cryptography challenges.
- Guided learning paths and progressive difficulty.
- Coverage of classical ciphers, modern crypto, RSA, hashing, and web crypto.
- Built-in hints and explanations to support learning.

---

## Getting Started
1. Visit https://cryptohack.org and create an account.
2. Start with the learning paths or beginner tutorials.
3. Explore categories such as classical ciphers, modern cryptography, RSA, and hashing.
4. Recommended tools: Python 3, PyCryptodome/Crypto, hashlib, Jupyter Notebook, text editor, and basic command-line utilities.
5. Progress at your own pace many challenges provide hints and explanations.

---

## Mission Types & Difficulty

- **Classical Ciphers**: Caesar, Vigenère, substitution, and transposition ciphers.

- **Modern Cryptography**: AES, block cipher modes, stream ciphers.

- **RSA / Asymmetric Crypto**: Factorization, padding attacks, modular arithmetic.

- **Hashing & Integrity**: Hash cracking, HMAC, collisions.

- **Web Crypto**: Misuse of cryptography in web applications.

- **Problems**: Number theory, logic problems, and fundamental cryptography concepts.

---

## Typical Workflow for Solving Missions
1. Read the challenge description carefully.
2. Identify the cryptographic method or vulnerability.
3. Apply appropriate tools (Python, hash libraries, or other utilities).
4. Test your approach in a safe environment.
5. Verify your solution and submit.

## Contributing & Writeups
- **Contribute missions**: Some platforms accept user-submitted challenges; check CryptoHack guidelines for submission rules.  
- **Writeups**: When publishing a writeup, explain the reasoning, steps, and payloads avoid posting full spoilers without a content warning.  
- **Code of conduct**: Be respectful in community discussions. Don’t share personal data or illegal instructions.

---

## Security & Responsible Use
- **Legal**: Interact only with CryptoHack-provided infrastructure and assets.
- **Safety**: Do not reuse techniques on real systems without authorization. 
- **Privacy**: Run code or tests in isolated environments (VMs/containers) when needed.
- **Server operators**: Respect platform rules regarding solution sharing and spoilers.
