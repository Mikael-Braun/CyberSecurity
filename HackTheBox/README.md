## Overview
Hack The Box (HTB) is a widely used online platform that offers interactive cybersecurity training through gamified labs and challenges. Users solve realistic attack scenarios—called “boxes” or machines—by identifying vulnerabilities, escalating privileges, and capturing flags. The platform is used by students, security professionals, enterprises (for purple/blue/red team training), and competitive CTF players.

## Getting Started
1. Create an account at `https://www.hackthebox.com`.  
2. Complete the onboarding/registration challenge if required (some portions of HTB use a small “invite” challenge to join).  
3. Browse labs and categories: Active machines, retired machines (with writeups), challenges (crypto, reversing, web, pwn), and CTF events.  
4. Use a VPN or HTB client to connect to lab networks (follow HTB connection docs).  
5. Practice in isolated environments (VMs, containers) and respect lab rules about writeups and spoilers.

## Core Features
- **Machines / Boxes:** Hands‑on vulnerable hosts to exploit and own.  
- **Challenges:** Short, focused challenges (web, crypto, reversing, forensics, pwn).  
- **Retired Boxes & Writeups:** Many retired labs include official or community writeups for learning.  
- **Pro labs & Active CTFs:** Timed events and team competitions.  
- **Skill tracks & assessments:** Progression systems and skill rating.  
- **Enterprise / Team features:** Dedicated training for organizations (reporting, private labs, management).  
- **Marketplace & Jobs Board:** Opportunities to join teams or find security roles (varies by platform offerings).

## User Types & Subscriptions
HTB provides different access tiers, commonly including free and paid subscription plans that unlock additional content (Pro labs, retired machine access, Academy tracks, priority support). For organizations, HTB offers enterprise or team plans with administrative features.

---

## Learning Paths & Academy
HTB Academy (or equivalent learning tracks) offers structured courses and modules covering offensive security topics—each course typically includes theory, walk‑throughs, and lab exercises to practice the concepts hands‑on.

---

## Community & Collaboration
- **Forums / Discord / Social:** Active community for hints, guidance, and discussion (follow HTB rules on spoilers).  
- **Teams & Competitions:** Form teams for CTFs and collaborative red‑teaming exercises.  
- **Writeups & Blogs:** Community and official writeups are valuable learning resources; respect spoiler policies and embargoes.

---

## Security & Responsible Use
- **Users:** Always practice in HTB’s controlled environment. Don’t reuse exploit code against live production systems unless you have explicit permission. Maintain secure workflows (isolate tools, snapshot VMs, avoid saving sensitive credentials).  
- **Operators / Admins (Enterprise):** Use HTB’s team features for controlled training, follow data protection policies, and plan safe labs that don’t expose real customer data.

---

## History & Impact
Hack The Box has become one of the leading practical cybersecurity training platforms, known for realistic labs and an engaged community. It’s widely used by individuals preparing for security careers and by companies for staff upskilling and assessments. HTB’s model of gamified hands‑on learning influenced many modern security training providers.
